How to Set It Up

Step 1: Download the Addons

First, download the addons package I provide.

Step 2: Install in Blender

Open Blender.

Go to Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install.

Select the downloaded addon .zip file and install it.

Make sure the addon is enabled (check the box).

Step 3: Import Your Model

Import your 3D model into Blender.

Select the armature (skeleton) that came with your model.

Step 4: Fix Bones & Shape Keys

Press the Fix Bones button.

Then press the Fix Shape Keys button.

This will rename the bones and shape keys so they work correctly with the system.

If this doesn’t work, I’ve included a list of blend shapes below and where they should go.

Step 5: Set Up the Eyes (Manual for Now)

Currently, the eye setup isn’t automated (I’ll add a button in a future release).

For now, do it manually:

Go into Edit Mode for the bones.

Select the eye bones.

Rotate them so the eyes sit in the middle of the sockets at a 90° angle, with the thin part pointing up.

In the bone’s roll, set it to -90°.

If it doesn’t look right, play around with small adjustments — this setup worked for me.

Step 6: Start Face Tracking

Select your model’s armature.

It should automatically detect and connect to your model’s face.

Choose your tracking method from the addon panel.

Update the IP address to match your setup (replace it with your device’s IP).
